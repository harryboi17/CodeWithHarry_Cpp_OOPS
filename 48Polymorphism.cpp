//Polymorphism
// - One name and multiple forms
// - eg. Function Overloading, operational Overloading 

/*
Polymosphism in C++ can be of two types:
1. Compile time Polymorphism     //Binding of function is already done with the particular code
    1.1 - Function Overloading
    1.2 - Operator Overloading
2. Run Time Polymorphism         //Binding of function is done during run time.
    2.1 Virtual functions
